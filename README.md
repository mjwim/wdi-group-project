## SPLITTIN

###What is SPLITTIN

SPLITTIN is an app that allows you to set up a holiday with friends and keep track of bills that individuals have paid for on behalf of the whole group.
 
During the trip you can upload bills and tag them to the place where they were incurred. You can then see how much you have spent as a group, how much you have spent as an induividual and whether you owe your friends or they owe you.

Only those on the trip can see the details of the bills paid.

###How to use

An user can register/login and then view their profile page, which will show the trips that they either created or have been invited on.

On an individual trip page, the creator can add friends to the trip

Any member of the trip can then add a bill, which is tagged to the location of where it was incurred.

On adding a bill this will update the total group expenditure and the individuals expenditure and then update the pie chart showing the split of expenditure between the members.

Additionally, the amount the the individual either owes or is owed (their balance) will be updated.

###Creating SPLITTIN

SPLITTIN was a group project put together by three genuine legends. For all of us this was our first experience of collaborating on GitHub.

Planning was therefore even more important than usual to avoid major issues, be they conflict error in the codebase or differences in artistic opinion.
